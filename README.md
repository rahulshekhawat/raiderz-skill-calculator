# RaiderZ Skill Calculator

This repository contains the source code for non-java version of RaiderZ Skill Calculator that is compatible with WildRaiderZ's Level 50 skill cap.

### Features and improvements over Java version:
* Available points are 50 to match WildRaiderZ's level 50 cap instead of 40 points.
* Unavailable skills have a semi-transparent white overlay to make it easier to distinguish between available and unavailable skills.
* Allows taking a picture of current tree
* Elements of skill description are highlighted in different colors, making skill description easier to read.
* Maxxed skills don't animate on hover.
